You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, \"Do you want to pick door No. 2?\" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome","text":"Hi, my name is Ahmad Siavashi.
