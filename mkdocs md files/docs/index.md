Hi!  Welcome to my home page.  

I'm Ahmad, and I was born in _1993_ in `Ilam`, Iran.  
As a carious boy in my childhood,
I rediscovered a lot of already discovered things.  
During high school, my general branch
at National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents (or simply `NODET`) was `Mathematics and Physics`.
Suddenly I grow up! then found myself studying my _B.Sc._ in `Software Engineering`
at `Shiraz University`, some __1000km__ away from my hometown.  
Nowadays I'm getting my _M.Sc._ in `Architectures of Computer Systems` at `Tehran Polytechnic` (aka `Amirkabir University of Technology`), and work at `Dade Pardaz Sharq`.

My research interests are in the area of GPU architecture and GPU-based systems' architecture.

I speak four different languages (`Arabic`, `Persian`, `Kurdish`, and `English`) and I'm in love with `Books` and `Instrumental Music`.  
Looking forward to hearning from you =)
